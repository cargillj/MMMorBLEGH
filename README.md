# MMMorBLEGH
It's hard to choose where to eat.  Let MMMorBLEGH flip the coin for you.

Welcome to the source code for my web application designed to help users
in the corvallis area find a restaurant to eat at.  Oftentimes users have
a fixed set of restaurants that they are considering, but no way of making
a quick decision amidst equally enjoyable choices.  With mmmorblegh, users
can spend less time thinking and more time munching!

This app is written in Python and powered by the Google Application Engine.
